    <h1> Welcome to our website </h1>
    <p> Welcome on my site, let me introduce you teleradiology with the following questions for which wikip√©dia give an answer.<br />
    Because of the deadline of this project some features aren't implemented, sorry by advance if you can't do everything you want to do.<br />
    Even if the login interface is not implemented every pictures and annotations must have an author.
    This site is supposed to be a plateform where two kind of professionals have access :<br /> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clinical technicians : Upload pictures coming from RMI examination.</li>
        <li>Radiologic expert : Annotate pictures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the aim to be realist every picture must have been taken during an examination. <br />
    In the database there are three examinations added by default to be used in the context of this project.<br />
    To upload picture you are forced to give an examination id, only 1, 2 and 3 are available in this project version.<br /><br />
    This site had been created with <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> language using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask module</a> and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite3</a> database.<br />
